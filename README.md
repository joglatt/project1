### Bands and Booze App 

### Our project 1 - 'Bands and Booze' app was created during the beginning of April, 2018. 

### This app takes a user search entry of a band or musician and taps the Bandsintown API for information on all of their upcoming shows. Once the results come through it populates the browser page with selected information. 

### Users can find the show they are interested in and either click a link to buy tickets or click to see our pop-up map that was created by utilizing the venue results from the Bandsintown app and referencing this as the location to call from the Google Maps and Google Places API.  The map has customized beer markers for the bars located closest to the venue. 

### We used a combination of Materialize and CSS to style the page. 

### If you're interested in using multiple APIs, the Bandsintown or Google Maps / Places, or Materialize this page might be helpful.
